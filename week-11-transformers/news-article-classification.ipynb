        "\n",
        "### In the transformer architecture in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", how does Multi-head Attention work?\n",
        "Multi-head Attention is a module for attention mechanisms which runs through an attention mechanism several times in parallel. The independent attention outputs are then concatenated and linearly transformed into the expected dimension. Intuitively, multiple attention heads allows for attending to parts of the sequence differently (e.g. longer-term dependencies versus shorter-term dependencies). [Source](https://paperswithcode.com/method/multi-head-attention#:~:text=Multi%2Dhead%20Attention%20is%20a,transformed%20into%20the%20expected%20dimension.).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is the main idea behind Positional Encoding?\n",
        "Positional encoding describes the location or position of an entity in a sequence so that each position is assigned a unique representation. A very good explanation is available [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is EarlyStopping and why do we use it?\n",
        "Early stopping is a regularization technique that prevents overfitting. The general idea is to observe the validation dataset to detect overfitting and stop training when overfitting is detected. \n",
        "\n",
        "### How would explain what a transformer model is to business stakeholders (at a high level)?\n",
        "Transformers learn context (meaning) by tracking the relationships in sequential data (like the words in the sentence). The main difference between transformers and \"classical\" approaches is that transformers are also aware of the relationships (the order of the words). It increases the accuracy of the models and opens new application areas that are impossible for traditional models (e.g. one of Google Chatbots - `LaMDA` was so good that the researcher working with it claimed it is sentient).\n",
